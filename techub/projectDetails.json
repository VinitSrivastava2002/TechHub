Leonhard Euler proved that it was impossible to cross all the bridges without repeating and laid the foundation for graph theory and modern topology at the same time. This project is an iPad and iPhone game based on those famous bridges. Each level presents a puzzle with bridges to cross, houses to visit, and sometimes coins to collect.",
